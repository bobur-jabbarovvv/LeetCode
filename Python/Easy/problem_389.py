You are given two strings s and t.
String t is generated by random shuffling string s
and then add one more letter at a random position.
Return the letter that was added to t.

Example 1:
    Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
    Output: "e"
Explanation:
    'e' is the letter that was added.

Example 2:
    Input: s = "", t = "y"
    Output: "y"
