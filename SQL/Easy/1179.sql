1179. Reformat Department Table

Table: Department
    +-------------+---------+
    | Column Name | Type    |
    +-------------+---------+
    | id          | int     |
    | revenue     | int     |
    | month       | varchar |
    +-------------+---------+
In SQL,(id, month) is the primary key of this table.
The table has information about the revenue of each department per month.
The month has values in ["Jan","Feb","Mar","Apr","May","Jun","Jul","Aug","Sep","Oct","Nov","Dec"].

Reformat the table such that there is a department id column and
a revenue column for each month.
Return the result table in any order.
The result format is in the following example.

Example 1:
Input: 
Department table:
    +------+---------+-------+
    | id   | revenue | month |
    +------+---------+-------+
    | 1    | 8000    | Jan   |
    | 2    | 9000    | Jan   |
    | 3    | 10000   | Feb   |
    | 1    | 7000    | Feb   |
    | 1    | 6000    | Mar   |
    +------+---------+-------+
Output: 
    +------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-----+-------------+
    | id   | Jan_Revenue | Feb_Revenue | Mar_Revenue | ... | Dec_Revenue |
    +------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-----+-------------+
    | 1    | 8000        | 7000        | 6000        | ... | null        |
    | 2    | 9000        | null        | null        | ... | null        |
    | 3    | null        | 10000       | null        | ... | null        |
    +------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-----+-------------+
Explanation:
    The revenue from Apr to Dec is null.
Note that the result table has 13 columns (1 for the department id + 12 for the months).

-- Solution

SELECT
    id,
    -- picks the only non-NULL revenue value for that month
    -- (because each department has at most one row per month)
    MAX(IF(month = 'Jan', revenue, null)) AS Jan_Revenue,
    MAX(IF(month = 'Feb', revenue, null)) AS Feb_Revenue,
    MAX(IF(month = 'Mar', revenue, null)) AS Mar_Revenue,
    MAX(IF(month = 'Apr', revenue, null)) AS Apr_Revenue,
    MAX(IF(month = 'May', revenue, null)) AS May_Revenue,
    MAX(IF(month = 'Jun', revenue, null)) AS Jun_Revenue,
    MAX(IF(month = 'Jul', revenue, null)) AS Jul_Revenue,
    MAX(IF(month = 'Aug', revenue, null)) AS Aug_Revenue,
    MAX(IF(month = 'Sep', revenue, null)) AS Sep_Revenue,
    MAX(IF(month = 'Oct', revenue, null)) AS Oct_Revenue,
    MAX(IF(month = 'Nov', revenue, null)) AS Nov_Revenue,
    MAX(IF(month = 'Dec', revenue, null)) AS Dec_Revenue

    Department
